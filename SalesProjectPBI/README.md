##    Sales Analysis Project

This project involves in creating a dynamic dashboard that tracks key metrics. Sales, Profit, Quantity across all regions: Central, East, West, South. The dashboard allows the user to filter the data by year (2021-2024) by type (Sales, Profit and Quantity) and additioanally it includes a comparison between previous year's figures and current year's figures.

## KPI's requirements

I created a dynamic selector for Sales, Profit and Quantity. The dashboard displays the data based on this selection and it has a chart that shows the chosen metric by month, along with an average line for better trend analysis.
